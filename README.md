## Pitch Pipe
This is a voice-enabled pitch pipe that plays pitches from C4 to B5. Pitch files are available in my 'pitch' repo. I was inspired to make this after writing my Clearpitch Pitch Pipe app for Android, and decided to port it to voice.

## Scotty Eats
This is my attempt to adapt http://cmueats.com/ to voice. I access the same API as this website, and respond to queries like "Is the Exchange open?" and "Are any pizza places open?" This was definitely one of my favorite voice projects because of the multitude of ways in which people can ask the same questions.
